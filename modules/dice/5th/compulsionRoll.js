For one scene, the vampire must feed on at least one Hunger from anyone, friend or foe, who goes against one of their Convictions. Failure to do so results in a three-dice penalty to all rolls until the Compulsion is fulfilled or the scene concludes. If the individual fed upon is also a vampire, a Bane-induced Hunger frenzy test should be performed.\nPage 18 Players Guide",

The Compulsion persists until the vampire successfully causes the transition, whether it be killing or reviving something, either literally or metaphorically.\nPage 24 Players Guide",

      "Lasombra loathe failure, viewing it as a sign of poor planning or personal weakness. This compulsion drives them to take any imaginable action to achieve their goals, whether in the moment or through elaborate schemes spanning centuries. Any setback deeply affects them, and they quickly resort to ruthless methods to succeed.\nUpon failing any action, the vampire receives a two-dice penalty to all rolls until they successfully accomplish the same action in a future attempt or until the scene ends. This penalty also applies to future attempts at the triggering action.\nPage 30 Players Guide",

      "The Malkavian's heightened senses lead them into a world of possibly genuine truths or omens, though others dismiss these visions as mere products of their Hunger-induced imagination.

During one scene, the vampire suffers a two-dice penalty to rolls involving Dexterity, Manipulation, Composure, and Wits, as well as rolls to resist terror frenzy.\nPage 210 Corebook",

      "The vampire is consumed by a relentless hunger for knowledge, a need to uncover exclusive and hidden truths, akin to their thirst for blood. They withhold secrets from others, only exchanging them in strict barter for more valuable ones.\nAny action not directed towards uncovering a secret incurs a two-dice penalty. The Compulsion concludes when the vampire discovers a significant and useful secret, and whether they choose to share it remains optional.\nPage 210 Corebook",

  RAVNOS: {
    name: "Tempting Fate",

      "The vampire's Blood drives them to seek out perilous situations.

  TOREADOR: {
    name: "Obsession",
    description:
      "The Toreador becomes captivated by one exquisite thing, be it a person, song, artwork, or even a sunrise. They can hardly divert their attention and only speak about the beloved subject.

  TREMERE: {
    name: "Perfectionism",

      "The Tremere demands nothing less than excellence. Until the vampire scores a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene concludes, they suffer a two-dice penalty to all dice pools.

  VENTRUE: {
    name: "Arrogance",
    description:
      "The Ventrue is driven by the need to rule and assumes control of any situation. Someone must obey an order from the vampire. Any action not related to leadership receives a two-dice penalty.
