# General
- Fixed bugs in the Shard event Handlers
- Updated to Discord API v9
- Updated to Discord.js v13
- Message handeling changed to Slash Commands
- Threads now supported

# v20 rolls
- Redesigned the look of the v20 Roll
- Redesigned the look of v20 Init
- Added a willpower option
- Added a character option
- The roller has been tied into the tracker. Using willpower and Character options will automaticly update you willpower. It will also warn you if you attempt to use willpower with none available.

# v5 rolls
- Added Rouse roll
- Res roll can select resonance and or temp from a list
- Added surge option to v5 roll
- Added rouse option to v5 roll
- Added spec option to v5 roll
- removed /rr command in favor of Interactions on the main roll
- Due to limitations on Discord Interactions and to clean up the channel, rerolls must be made within 15min of the roll

# Tracker
- names can now be more then one word
- names can now be changed using set
- names are now unique to a player rather than a server
- side bar colour can now be changed using set [Supporter Only]
- Images can now be set [Supporter Only]
- 20th edition vamipres can now define their morality
- Find a character now brings up a drop down menu to select that character
- Deleting characters is now done via a drop down menu and a confirmation will be asked before it is deleted.


# Ideas
- /find @user (ST only). Brings a list of characters in the server. 
User button and choice box to select the character to find.
/delete (user). Does the same as above.

- /help and /key will provide select box to zoom in on a document

- Add a compulsion roll for v5

- Add character option to v5 and rouse and update hunger on failed rouse.

- Add dice stats. Track passes, fails, crits, botches, messy crits and bestial fails. 

- Tracking add a hidden command with optional ST channel.
Using the command in a channel will hide all tracking responses.
Adding an ST channel will post a second non hidden message in that channel.

- Add tracking for LARP characters

- Maybe Nightmare dice for changeling

# Notes
- More then 25 characters might be a problem for the drop down box. Maybe add a second select menu if there are more then 25. Dynamicly add select menus up to 5? that is 150 characters.
- When a member leaves a guild, disconnect their characters and delete the member
- When a user deletes a character, the site checks if there are no more characters for that member. Before deleting that member check if the user is registered. If so don't delete.
- Mage20th Quint and Paradox is not being tracked correctly. The bars can overlap p331. Make them 20 points each and Quint cannot be higher then paradox.
display that as a single 20 point bar with quint from the left and para from the right.
- Changling Banality, werewolf rage not limited by max. Maybe add a locked propertie and if unlocked the current can exeed the max. Change colour on the bar to denote excess.
- Make sure a linked character is using the correct version Dice roller.
- 10 points of temp torment gets converted to one point of permenant torment
