# Known Bugs

# Ideas
- /find @user (ST only). Brings a list of characters in the server. 
User button and choice box to select the character to find.
/delete (user). Does the same as above.

- /help and /key will provide select box to zoom in on a document

- Add a compulsion roll for v5

- Add character option to v5 and rouse and update hunger on failed rouse.

- Add dice stats. Track passes, fails, crits, botches, messy crits and bestial fails. 

- Add tracking for LARP characters

- Nightmare dice for changeling. Only 10 is meaningingful for that. Maybe draw a custom nightmare 10 for the roll.

- Track user usage over 14days/30days/1year and all time. Only need to keep one date. The last updated. From this can derive the rest through filters.

- Add a consumable X amount at X time interval.

- Chronicles of Darkness Dice roller

- Update v5 Emojis to look more like dice

# Notes
- When a member leaves a guild, disconnect their characters and delete the member. Cannot do this without guild member intents (should request)
- Maybe add v5 rouse and surge checks to the roll embed rather then follow ups.
- Fix supporter stuff to work with new DB. Find a way to update From the role on my server

# Priority List
1. Add ST find/delete all functions
2. Dice history Tracking
3. tie v5 characters to dice rolls
