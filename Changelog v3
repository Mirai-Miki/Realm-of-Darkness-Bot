# Ideas
- /find @user (ST only). Brings a list of characters in the server. 
User button and choice box to select the character to find.
/find (user). Does the same as above.

- /help and /key will provide select box to zoom in on a document

- Add a compulsion roll for v5

- Add character option to v5 and rouse and update hunger on failed rouse.

- Tracking add a hidden command with optional ST channel.
Using the command in a channel will hide all tracking responses.
Adding an ST channel will post a second non hidden message in that channel.
